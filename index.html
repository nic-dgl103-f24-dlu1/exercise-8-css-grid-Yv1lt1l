          Hello, I'm a college student at NIC taking the Digital Design and
          Devlopement Diploma and currently in the 8th week. So far, I feel I
          have been struggling with applying the layout modes despite having
          near perfect quiz marks.

        <p>
          I often forget and have trouble with deciding which element/parent to
          enable the mode through the display poperty. That and sometimes when I
          used the justify content property, It wouldn't behave as expected such
          as not centering text.

          languages, next term I will be learning Javascript. My other skills
          and hobbies include being an amateur author and rendering artist.
